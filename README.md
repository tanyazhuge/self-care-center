# Self Care Center
## Overview

Solo Care Center will be my 2nd solo project. In this project, I build an application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to return either affirmations or mantras to continue positive thinking.
*Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.*
*Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.*
I build my application by starting to fill out all basic elements in HTML, then creating the style in CSS and functionality in JavaScript. From this project, I came to appreciate there is so much more to learn about HTML and CSS.

#### Technologies:
Google
W3Schools
StackOverflow

#### Instructions:
In my project, the user need to select either affirmation or mantra and press receive message button to display message. If user does not select one of the two options and press receive message button, there would be an error message to remind user to select. The user can clear the message by pressing the Clear Message button when the message is displayed.
